# Jellyseerr Media Cleaner

This Python tool automatically deletes old movies and TV shows that were previously requested through Jellyseerr.

It's useful for home media servers with limited space and supports:
- Per-user whitelisting (media is never deleted if requested by whitelisted users)
- Dry-run mode (safe preview of what would be deleted)
