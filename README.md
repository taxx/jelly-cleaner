# Jellyseer Media Cleaner

This Python tool automatically deletes old movies and TV shows that were previously requested through Jellyseer, using the Radarr and Sonarr APIs.

It's useful for home media servers with limited space and supports:
- Separate retention periods for movies and TV shows
- Per-user whitelisting (media is never deleted if requested by whitelisted users)
- Dry-run mode (safe preview of what would be deleted)
